Projects are stored as a document, which in turn has sections.
The sections are very Notion-like, being like pages and such; and are nested within eachother.

Sections can be text, bullet points, checkboxes, or references to another page.
Some things like bullet points have 'subsections'; things like text and page references that sit inside them. However, you cant stack bullet points or checkboxes on eachother.
